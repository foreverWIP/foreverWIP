### Amy Wright

Trans developer (she/her), lover of hedgehogs and gamedev.
I am currently working on Sonic 2 HD, an ambitious fangame you can find [here](https://sonic2hd.com/) (currently not listed on the site, but am a part of the team).
There are other private personal projects I've worked on, and at least one soon-public project I can't describe right now!
I'm proficient with C# and .NET technologies, and I take great interest in software and hardware systems of all sorts (especially data formats and language implementations).
I also have experience writing Python, Lua, M68k assembly, and scant bits of C/C++.
I'm a fast learner, so even if you have a stack I'm not familiar with, I can pick it up quickly.
If you want to get in contact, send a message through Twitter!
